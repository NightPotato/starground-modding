Thank you so much for wanting to mod Starground!

This template project is setup for modding, and can be used as a base example for your own mod.

Check out the wiki page on the modding Github here: https://github.com/chip003/starground-modding

-------------------------INFO.JSON-------------------------

	You'll need to include a JSON file called 'info.json'. This will contain crucial information about your mod.

	An example 'info.json' file is already included in the project (or can be downloaded), which can be modified and used as a template.

	Below goes over what needs to be inside of 'info.json':

	* Format		| This is a number that denotes the current version of the 'info.json' file. Different versions will be formatted differently.

	* ID			| ID is a unique identifier for your mod. This can cause serious issues if it's the same as another mod, so air on the side of length.
					| Including an author name and mod name like 'bbg_recipe_overhaul' is good, something like 'my_mod' is bad!
					| This should never change once your mod is created or updated. Pick something unique and stick with it!
				
	* DisplayName	| Display name is the name that is displayed for your mod. This can be freely changed when updating your mod.
					| This is shown in the mod menu, and any other place your mod is listed. This name also supports BBCode tags.
					
	* ModVersion	| This is a version identifier for your mod. This is so you and players can keep track of what version your mod is.

	* Description	| This is a description for your mod. This will be displayed in the mod menu, and supports BBCode tags.

	* GameVersions	| This is an array that holds strings for what game versions are supported. If your mod works in multiple versions, list them there.

	* Author		| This is you! Put whatever name you would like so you can take credit for your hard work.
