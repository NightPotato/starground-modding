# Contributing to the Wiki
While contribution are helpful and accepted, they are not a requirement and you should not feel like you have to contribute. However, if you want to contribute to the wiki then you can follow the guide below.

***
### Forking the Github Repository.
Due to the nature of Github and the way not collaborators have to to submit Pull-Requests, you will need to for the main [Modding Github Repo](https://github.com/chip003/starground-modding). This will allow you to make local changes to the wiki and use them in a Pull-Request.
### Making your Changes
Now you can clone your forked repository to your computer. Once you have done so, you can open the `docs/` directory and make edits to the `.md` files which is the content for the wiki. Make sure to update `_sidebar.md` for your pages to be shown.
### Creating a Pull Request
I will be showing how to open a Pull Request on [Github Modding Repo](https://github.com/chip003/starground-modding), if you run into any issues please feel free to ask in Discord or open an Issue.
